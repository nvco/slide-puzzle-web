## Technical Decisions Made

### Framework & Tools
- ✅ **Vue.js 3**: Chosen for mobile performance and simplicity
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
- ✅ **Vite**: Build tool for fast development and GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ **Pinia**: State management for game state
- ✅ **Lucide Vue**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- ✅ **GitHub Pages**: Free static hosting with GitHub Actions deployment

### Architecture Decisions
- ✅ **Pre-curated images**: No user uploads, curated image library
- ✅ **Random with memory**: Track shown images to ensure variety
- ✅ **Mobile-first**: Primary focus on mobile interaction
- ✅ **Single-page app**: Everything loads on first visit
- ✅ **Documentation structure**: context/ folder for organized docs
- ✅ **Simplified UI**: Clean, minimal interface without excessive animations

### UX Flow Decisions
- ✅ **Welcome animation**: Demo sliding + greeting message
- ✅ **Preview then flip**: Show solved puzzle before scrambling
- ✅ **3D flip transition**: Dramatic animation between states
- ✅ **Simple victory feedback**: Title change instead of celebrations
- ✅ **Solvable shuffling**: Guaranteed solvable puzzles
- ✅ **Icon-based restart**: RotateCcw icon with pulsing animation when won

## Key Technical Achievements

### Solvable Shuffling Algorithm ✅
- **Problem Solved**: Random shuffling can create unsolvable puzzles
- **Solution**: Start with solved state and make only valid moves
- **Implementation**: `gameStore.scrambleBoard()` method
- **Validation**: `usePuzzleLogic.isSolvable()` function
- **Fallback**: Safe shuffle method for edge cases

### Simplified Victory System ✅
- **Previous**: Complex confetti and celebration animations
- **Current**: Simple title change and restart button pulsing
- **Benefit**: Cleaner UI, better performance, less visual clutter
- **Implementation**: Reactive title computed property with win-state pulsing

### Accessibility Compliance ✅
- **Focus States**: Proper keyboard navigation
- **ARIA Labels**: Screen reader support
- **Touch Targets**: 44px minimum for mobile
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper roles and structure
- **Cursor Feedback**: Grab cursor only on moveable pieces

### GitHub Pages Deployment ✅
- **Automatic Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow on push to main
- **Base Path Configuration**: Proper Vite config for GitHub Pages routing
- **Live URL**: https://nvco.github.io/slide-puzzle-web/
- **Build Process**: Optimized production builds with automatic deployment

## Final Design Decisions

### Celebration System - REMOVED ✅
- **Removed**: Confetti animations, big bang effects, star particles
- **Reasoning**: Cleaner interface, better performance, less distracting
- **Replacement**: Simple title change provides sufficient feedback

### Title System - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- **Playing State**: "You can do it !"
- **Victory State**: "Told ya !"
- **Implementation**: Reactive computed property in App.vue
- **Benefit**: Encouraging feedback without visual clutter

### Icon System - SIMPLIFIED ✅
- **Final Choice**: Always use RotateCcw icon (removed Power icon)
- **Animation**: Static design with click animation and victory pulsing
- **Color**: Matches title color using color-mix CSS function
- **Behavior**: Pulses continuously when puzzle is solved

### Interaction Design - REFINED ✅
- **Hover Effects**: Removed scale transforms from puzzle pieces
- **Cursor Behavior**: Grab cursor only on moveable pieces
- **Button Feedback**: Click animation with opacity change
- **Touch Targets**: Maintain 44px minimum for accessibility
