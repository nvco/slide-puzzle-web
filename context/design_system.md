# Design System & UI Guidelines

## Design Philosophy

Create a clean, focused interface that feels like a digital toy without overwhelming users. The design captures the tactile nature of classic slide puzzles while maintaining modern simplicity and accessibility. **Simplicity over complexity** - removed distracting animations in favor of clear, meaningful feedback.

## Visual Identity

### Color Palette
**Dynamic Color System**:
- Uses CSS `color-mix()` function for consistent color relationships
- Example: `color-mix(in srgb, var(--current-puzzle-color) 60%, black 30%)`
- High contrast for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- Colors adapt to puzzle image for cohesive theming

**Design Tokens**:
- Primary colors extracted from puzzle images
- Consistent opacity and mix ratios across UI elements
- Accessible contrast ratios maintained automatically

### Typography
**Implementation**:
- Clean, readable system fonts
- Appropriate sizing for mobile (minimum 16px)
- Clear hierarchy with consistent spacing
- Playful messaging: "You can do it !" â†’ "Told ya !"

**Title System**:
- **Playing State**: "You can do it !" (encouraging)
- **Victory State**: "Told ya !" (celebratory but simple)
- **Reactivity**: Changes instantly when puzzle is solved
- **Styling**: Matches overall color theme

## Component Guidelines

### Puzzle Board
**Visual Style**:
- Rounded corners for tactile feel
- Clean borders without excessive shadows
- Smooth piece sliding animations
- **No hover effects**: Removed zoom animations for cleaner interaction

**Interaction Behavior**:
- **Cursor Management**: `cursor-grab` only on moveable pieces
- Touch-friendly piece size (44px minimum)
- Immediate visual feedback during piece movement
- Smooth snap-to-grid behavior

### Game Controls
**Button Design**:
- **Icon-based**: RotateCcw icon from Lucide
- **Static design**: No hover effects, no transitions
- **Color**: Matches title using CSS color-mix
- **Size**: Appropriate touch target (44px+)

**Interaction States**:
- **Default**: Static, clean appearance
- **Click Animation**: Brief opacity fade (0.3) with 200ms transition
- **Victory State**: Continuous pulsing animation when puzzle is solved
- **No Hover**: Simplified for better mobile experience

### Victory Feedback System
**Simplified Approach** (removed complex celebrations):
- **Title Change**: Simple text update provides clear feedback
- **Button Pulsing**: Restart button pulses when puzzle is solved
- **No Particles**: Removed confetti, stars, and big bang animations
- **Performance**: Better performance without complex animations

**Animation Details**:
- **Pulse Animation**: 1.5s ease-in-out infinite
- **Opacity Range**: 1.0 to 0.3 and back
- **Trigger**: Activates when `isPuzzleSolved` is true
- **Cleanup**: Stops when game restarts

## Removed Features (Simplified Design)

### Celebration Animations - REMOVED
**What was removed**:
- Confetti particle system (50 particles with physics)
- Big bang explosion effects
- Star shower animations
- Complex overlay with multiple animation layers

**Why removed**:
- **Performance**: Reduced computational overhead
- **Focus**: Less distraction from core puzzle experience
- **Accessibility**: Reduces motion for sensitive users
- **Maintenance**: Simpler codebase

**Replacement**:
- Simple title change provides sufficient victory feedback
- Restart button pulsing gives clear next action indication

### Hover Effects - SIMPLIFIED
**Removed**:
- `hover:scale-105` from puzzle pieces
- Complex hover states on non-interactive elements
- Unnecessary zoom animations

**Benefit**:
- **Touch-first**: Better mobile experience
- **Performance**: Fewer CSS transforms
- **Clarity**: Clear distinction between interactive/non-interactive

## Interactive States

### Puzzle Piece States
- **Default**: Clean, ready appearance
- **Moveable**: `cursor-grab` indicates interactivity
- **Non-moveable**: Default cursor, no special styling
- **Moving**: Visual feedback during slide animation
- **No Hover**: Simplified interaction model

### Button States
- **Static Design**: No hover, focus, or transition effects
- **Click Animation**: Brief opacity change on activation
- **Victory Pulsing**: Continuous animation when puzzle solved
- **Color Coordination**: Matches theme using CSS color functions

## Animation Guidelines

### Core Animations (Kept)
- **Welcome Sequence**: Demo sliding + greeting message
- **3D Flip Transition**: Dramatic puzzle reveal animation
- **Piece Movement**: Smooth sliding with easing
- **Click Feedback**: Simple opacity animation

### Removed Animations
- **Victory Celebrations**: All particle effects removed
- **Hover Effects**: Scale transforms on puzzle pieces
- **Complex Transitions**: Simplified to essential animations only

### Animation Principles
- **Essential Only**: Animations serve clear functional purpose
- **Performance First**: CSS transforms over JavaScript animations
- **Accessibility**: Respects user motion preferences
- **Duration**: Appropriate timing (not too fast/slow)

## Responsive Design

### Mobile First Approach
**Small Screens (320px - 768px)**:
- Single column layout
- Full-width puzzle board with proper aspect ratio
- Touch-optimized controls (44px+ targets)
- Simplified navigation

**Medium Screens (768px - 1024px)**:
- Centered puzzle board
- Larger touch targets where beneficial
- More breathing room around elements

**Large Screens (1024px+)**:
- Puzzle board centered with max-width
- Keyboard navigation support
- Desktop-appropriate spacing

## Accessibility Features

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast maintained through color-mix functions
- Scalable text and UI elements
- Clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- No color-only communication

### Motor Accessibility
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- **Cursor feedback**: Grab cursor only where appropriate
- Simplified interaction patterns
- Forgiving touch areas

### Motion Accessibility
- **Reduced animations**: Simplified celebration system
- Essential animations only
- Respects user motion preferences
- Performance optimized

## CSS Architecture

### Utility-First Approach
- **Tailwind CSS**: Primary styling method
- **No Inline Styles**: All styling via utility classes
- **Custom CSS**: Only for complex animations not covered by Tailwind
- **File Size**: Keep custom CSS files under 100 lines

### Color System Implementation
```css
/* Example: Dynamic color coordination */
color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--current-puzzle-color) 60%, black 30%);
```

### Animation Implementation
```css
/* Victory pulsing animation */
@keyframes pulse-icon {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0.3; }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Removed Complex Animations**: Eliminated particle systems
- **CSS over JavaScript**: Use CSS transforms for animations
- **Minimal Custom CSS**: Rely on Tailwind utilities
- **Essential Features Only**: Focus on core puzzle experience

### Bundle Size
- **Utility-first CSS**: Optimal with Tailwind's JIT compilation
- **No Animation Libraries**: Use native CSS animations
- **Selective Imports**: Only import needed Lucide icons

## Brand Personality

### Voice & Tone
- **Encouraging**: "You can do it !" for motivation
- **Celebratory**: "Told ya !" for achievement
- **Clean**: Simple, direct communication
- **Focused**: Puzzle-solving without distractions

### Visual Personality
- **Clean**: Minimal, uncluttered interface
- **Tactile**: Feels like physical puzzle pieces
- **Responsive**: Smooth, purposeful animations
- **Accessible**: Inclusive design for all users

## Implementation Notes

### Component Structure
- Keep Vue components under 300 lines
- Extract reusable logic to composables
- Use Tailwind utilities over custom CSS
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

### State Management
- Simple reactive properties for UI state
- Computed properties for derived states
- Clear separation between game logic and UI logic
- Minimal watchers for performance
