# Design System & UI Guidelines

## Design Philosophy

Create a playful, engaging interface that feels like a digital toy. The design should capture the tactile, colorful nature of classic plastic slide puzzles while being optimized for modern mobile interaction.

## Visual Identity

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors** (to be defined during development):
- Bright, child-friendly colors
- High contrast for accessibility
- Plastic toy-inspired gradients and shadows

**Considerations**:
- Colors should work well with user-uploaded images
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios
- Consider colorblind accessibility

### Typography
**Requirements**:
- Playful but readable fonts
- Large enough for children to read easily
- Clear hierarchy for instructions and UI elements
- Mobile-optimized sizing

## Component Guidelines

### Puzzle Board
**Visual Style**:
- Rounded corners mimicking physical puzzle pieces
- Drop shadows for depth and tactile feel
- Smooth animations between states
- Clear visual feedback for interactive elements

**Behavior**:
- Touch-friendly piece size (minimum 44px touch targets)
- Visual indication of moveable pieces
- Smooth sliding animations
- Satisfying feedback when pieces snap into place

### Image Gallery
**Layout**:
- Grid layout with consistent spacing
- Thumbnail previews with hover/touch effects
- Category organization with clear headers
- Easy scrolling/browsing on mobile

**Visual Treatment**:
- Rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Loading states for images
- Selected state visual indication
- Responsive grid that adapts to screen size

### Navigation & Controls
**Design Principles**:
- Large, obvious buttons for children
- Clear iconography with text labels
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Finger-friendly touch targets

## Animation Guidelines

### Welcome Sequence
- Smooth, engaging entry animation
- Pieces sliding to demonstrate functionality
- Welcoming message with playful typography
- Sets expectation for interactivity

### 3D Flip Transition
- Dramatic, toy-like flip animation
- Smooth easing curves (not linear)
- Appropriate duration (not too fast/slow)
- Clear before/after states

### Piece Movement
- Immediate response to touch
- Smooth sliding motion
- Satisfying snap-to-grid behavior
- Visual feedback during movement

### Victory Celebration
- Joyful, encouraging animation
- Particle effects or confetti
- Positive reinforcement messaging
- Clear call-to-action for next steps

## Responsive Design

### Mobile First Approach
**Small Screens (320px - 768px)**:
- Single column layout
- Full-width puzzle board
- Thumb-friendly navigation
- Simplified image gallery

**Medium Screens (768px - 1024px)**:
- Puzzle board remains centered
- Two-column image gallery
- Larger touch targets
- More breathing room

**Large Screens (1024px+)**:
- Puzzle board centered with max-width
- Multi-column image gallery
- Hover states for desktop interaction
- Keyboard navigation support

## Accessibility Features

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast mode support
- Scalable text and UI elements
- Clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Meaningful color choices (not color-only communication)

### Motor Accessibility
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Forgiving interaction areas
- Alternative input methods
- Customizable difficulty levels

### Cognitive Accessibility
- Clear, simple language
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Progress indicators
- Undo/hint functionality

## Interactive States

### Button States
- **Default**: Clear, inviting appearance
- **Hover**: Subtle scale or color change
- **Active**: Pressed/down visual feedback
- **Disabled**: Obvious unavailable state

### Puzzle Piece States
- **Default**: Neutral, ready for interaction
- **Hoverable**: Slight highlight (desktop)
- **Moveable**: Clear indication piece can slide
- **Moving**: Visual feedback during drag/slide
- **Correct Position**: Subtle success indicator

## Brand Personality

### Voice & Tone
- **Encouraging**: Positive reinforcement
- **Playful**: Fun without being overwhelming
- **Clear**: Simple, direct communication
- **Inclusive**: Welcoming to all skill levels

### Visual Personality
- **Tactile**: Feels like physical objects
- **Bright**: Colorful and engaging
- **Smooth**: Polished animations and transitions
- **Safe**: Child-appropriate and trustworthy
