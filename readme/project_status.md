## Technical Decisions Made

### Framework & Tools
- ✅ **Vue.js 3**: Chosen for mobile performance and simplicity
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
- ✅ **Vite**: Build tool for fast development
- ✅ **Pinia**: State management for game state
- ✅ **Build-time manifest**: Automatic image discovery

### Architecture Decisions
- ✅ **Pre-curated images**: No user uploads, curated image library
- ✅ **Random with memory**: Track shown images to ensure variety
- ✅ **Mobile-first**: Primary focus on mobile interaction
- ✅ **Single-page app**: Everything loads on first visit
- ✅ **Documentation structure**: readme/ folder for organized docs

### UX Flow Decisions
- ✅ **Welcome animation**: Demo sliding + greeting message
- ✅ **Preview then flip**: Show solved puzzle before scrambling
- ✅ **3D flip transition**: Dramatic animation between states
- ✅ **Victory options**: Multiple ways to continue playing

## Current Todos
