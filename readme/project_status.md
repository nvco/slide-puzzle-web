## Technical Decisions Made

### Framework & Tools
- ✅ **Vue.js 3**: Chosen for mobile performance and simplicity
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
- ✅ **Vite**: Build tool for fast development
- ✅ **Pinia**: State management for game state
- ✅ **Build-time manifest**: Automatic image discovery

### Architecture Decisions
- ✅ **Pre-curated images**: No user uploads, curated image library
- ✅ **Random with memory**: Track shown images to ensure variety
- ✅ **Mobile-first**: Primary focus on mobile interaction
- ✅ **Single-page app**: Everything loads on first visit
- ✅ **Documentation structure**: readme/ folder for organized docs

### UX Flow Decisions
- ✅ **Welcome animation**: Demo sliding + greeting message
- ✅ **Preview then flip**: Show solved puzzle before scrambling
- ✅ **3D flip transition**: Dramatic animation between states
- ✅ **Victory options**: Multiple ways to continue playing
- ✅ **Solvable shuffling**: Guaranteed solvable puzzles
- ✅ **Celebration system**: Confetti animation and victory stats

## Key Technical Achievements

### Solvable Shuffling Algorithm ✅
- **Problem Solved**: Random shuffling can create unsolvable puzzles
- **Solution**: Start with solved state and make only valid moves
- **Implementation**: `gameStore.scrambleBoard()` method
- **Validation**: `usePuzzleLogic.isSolvable()` function
- **Fallback**: Safe shuffle method for edge cases

### Celebration System ✅
- **Confetti Animation**: 50 colorful pieces with random timing
- **Victory Message**: Shows moves and time taken
- **Action Buttons**: Play again or choose new image
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade-in overlay with bounce-in animation

### Accessibility Compliance ✅
- **Focus States**: Proper keyboard navigation
- **ARIA Labels**: Screen reader support
- **Touch Targets**: 44px minimum for mobile
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper roles and structure

### Code Organization ✅
- **Component Extraction**: `PuzzlePiece.vue`, `GameControls.vue`
- **Composable Logic**: `usePuzzleLogic.js` for game logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error utilities
- **Performance**: Throttled interactions and cleanup

## Current Todos

### Completed ✅
All core functionality is working and tested.

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. **Additional image categories** for more variety
2. **Hint system** for players who get stuck
3. **Score tracking** and personal bests
